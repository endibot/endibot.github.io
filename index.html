  Is it bailey’s?
  Ben Coyle’s garden?
  Yeah a bit. How come?
  She’s from Oxford isn’t she
  She went to work there first two years of being a doctor I think
  That’s weird seeing as the main thing she’d know about me was I failed the year
  She wants to be a surgeon
  Uh, you can make something up that seems something the parents would like and put my name to it if you want
  Yeah
  Yeesh*
  Lol

  Checking out yards, pushing Tom to get the pizza oven going, chatting to Rowe, going on bike rides with Bailey, drinking fancy whiskey with Jenny, telling Parry to spend an extra 100k on the two bedroom so I can stay
  Just the usual
  Yeah any time

  Not fair
  Mah B
  True

  We should have a six person McDonald’s trip
  Safe as fuck in that place
  Sounds good
  Do you want to eat soil?
  Yeah I eat the patients
  Why do you think I’m trying to quit
  The boat was cozy and toasty, and even PCI Hemshall had to admit the boat as a whole exuded a sense of welcome
  I’m being played by Gary Oldman
  Wait there might be a hiccup
  Secondary to my getting the weak wrong
  Let me work through a few things
  Straighten out some kinks
  No just my lodgers mum might be staying that night so it would be awkies. I’m investigating
  What would people say to Saturday 17th instead?
  I mean, Sadie will be around too so only four people can come..
  Lol
  I mean, I think if they’re not in the garden with us it wouldn’t count, but yeah we just rather not have them around
  Tar
  Yar
  Ffs 😂🤣
  Who would’ve thunk
  Right round the corner from Tom
  I’ll be going too fast for that

  Shame you still can’t spell
  Unemployed idiot
  How was the other guy?
  Lol
  Wait is that real?
  Kidlington
  Yeah
  Is it?
  Think my dad’s friend is selling his house there and might be quite nice
  It was the universe sending you a ghost of yourself as karma
  Lool
  Guys bad news
  My dad and his wife want to get a 600k flat in Kidlington
  https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/85172260#/
  Only the bottom
  Have them with their flat mates I guess
  No so it’s not the top floor or the side. Like another thing is on the side apparently
  Yeah I think so. And then maybe there’s more ground floor that’s someone else’s that’s not on the floor plan?
  Yeah think so
  They do
  It’s a 993 year leasehold
  Rowe’s great great grandchildren gonna get conned into buying it with 1 year left by my son
  The guy above has freehold
  And this one has the leasehold
  No, the upstairs would own the downstairs
  Thanks baby 🦄
  That’s what I said
  I know so small
  Nah
  At least I assume
  Freehold man wants it for generations. Until he can unite it once more in a millenium
  I expressed the same sentiments
  In politer terms
  Nope
  It’s being sold by someone the know
  Who is sick
  Which I have been told is not influencing the situation
  But I am cynical
  How many square feet are our houses parry?
  Damn! Hoped there’d be like 10k a month and I could scotch the deal
  Thanks for looking though
  Me and you to my dad
  I know 🦠🦠🦠🦠🦠
  I tried to put the kabosh on it
  I tried!
  Think it’s happening though
  My dad wanted me to see it. Even though Annalise actually stayed there for a couple weeks once
  I was asked to spend my week off visiting 1m pound houses
  And I SPENT IT
  We will not be spending time in Kidlington
  Gonna have to change the door sign on Kate’s room Jack
  No more Pete Wentz. Time for Pete Endicott
  I think they don’t want all their money in property. And they’ve seen it
  You can renovate my mum’s ghost
  Cant* fuck!
  I’m Oliver fucking twist right now
  Promised riches
  Now a poor orphan
  I want a lot more than 50k
  I told my dad he should just keep Hill view
  Tbh
  I said sell half and buy your retirement shit hole with that
  Then let me have it
  £1.8k a month mortgage
  Could I make that?
  Easily if I have a job
  Got valued
  Guy said 690
  Kinda crazy
  I know!!
  Fuck me
  Why you there josh?
  Would actually send that to my dad but think I went in a bit hard
  He should’ve bought the palace
  Ok
  I’m dead
  Dat feel when you out of Kidlington
  Wow
  Not replying to my message and calling Rowe gay
  I don’t think so.. like at ‘social times’ on a weekend there’s just as many people around in oxford looking happy if you’re in the right places
  Like jack said it’s just fucking expensive
  And to do anything socially you normally have to travel like 45 mins
  Cause people live all over the place
  Lol
  He’ll take a chunk out of your hotel rooms balcony door
  Lol
  Is that jay Nash in the middle?
  I met Gino dicampos father in law

  Vecchione outside of tier 2
  Parties round his house
  Jesus

  Lol
  I’m making a cake :)
  Hi Jack this is dictated as well for my phone and it cost £200 and not £1000 fancy that! The cake I’m making is a sponge with icing and six letters and there’s going to be a hole cut in the middle in which chocolate coated cake balls are placed to create an exciting surprise when cutting to
  Hi Jack I wouldn’t pay £5 for phone that doesn’t filter out your level of bullshit
  And so we reach dictation’s limits
  Hi Jack the weather is middling to fair grey skies but no rain are cool possible I would say 14° forecast for the weekend I’m told is unfortunately rain rain
  Not got the coins 😂😂😂
  It’s got spider webs on if you look close
  Oooooh you guys wait
  There’s a surprise inside 😈
  It’s ducked!
  I’m gonna go on one last crusade
  Oh for sure
  Def that kind of crusade
  Has anyone seen the sopranos?
  Hope him and his family don’t win any money!
  😂

  Lol
  Your baby gonna marry Sam Moore baby at Matthew Arnold

  Glad the wind didn’t change on this year, Christ
  I have some _very_ specific requirement s
  I’m just working in A&E so need to look at my timetable
  Should be able to on my shift tonight
  They don’t furlough me in the hospital
  I’m getting a bunch of mushrooms
  So we can all go crazy in a dark room in December
  I had a dream we were at t 10 Christmas and did mushrooms and bailey was so drunk he was lying have conscious on the floor and josh made bailey give him a blow job and we were all there and then josh took a photo and sent it to the whatsapp and I still had that WhatsApp thing where your phone immediately downloads the photo and then I was at work at the hospital and the consultant saw I had a photo on my phone of bailey lying on the floor chugging josh’s dick and I got told off
  Love
  Jesus
  Our Covid ward is now rammed 😬
  Yep when I’m on call
  He messaged me saying he wants to hang out soon
  I’ll have a look now
  I been busy today
  Might not be lockdown
  Ok..
  Hooow crazy would it be to do January 1st? Or 2nd?
  ok Jan 2nd
  go on ladz
  more chance we could actually have a bang up meal in a restaurant
  kinda :(
  I should!
  I mean I could do the 12th or 13th, if we’re not still in lockdown
  But yeah why wouldn’t we do it when there’s a chance it could be nice
  Wish you could have polls on WhatsApp
  Why?
  Why?
  It’ll just be sad if I can’t come
  For me
  No it’s not
  Ok, 12th but if there’s a lockdown 2nd?
  you going to gym yet?
  fat fuck
  12th December but if they extend lockdown over it then 2nd january
  How come?
  Hope so :(
  How’s house stuff going party?
  Not bad
  Get them to move it back a week so we can have the after party at yours
  Don’t they realise they can just check your recent transactions online?
  I mean your crypto trades
  I mean... they decided to be accountants
  Fuck! Don’t show them the 2017 stuff!
  Nope
  Unless you were Vietcong
  Yes I was
  I went with my friend Ken
  WW1>Vietnam
  That’s what I’ve learnt so far
  That’s definitely the mainstream academic perspective
  They had an interlude to make sure people don’t get bored
  You sick?
  Yeah I guess strictly speaking in lockdown tests aren’t as necessary
  Better the devil you know though
  Probably due to the superspreader event you guys went to the other day
  “Cold”
  So it begins
  False positives almost never happen
  But the test is only 70% accurate - and sometimes less if asymptomatic/done as a home test
  70% sensitive
  It’s pretty much 100% specific
  Yeah
  It’s really not that reassuring if it’s negative
  But everyone thinks it is
  Oh yeah if you hit a garage gym with your homie you def don’t have it
  Like with my work Parry, I’d have to isolate for 2 weeks if around a swab positive patient. They shouldn’t even really bother about me having a negative swab
  Person* patients are fine cause I have PPE
  I know! I’ve got a friend who’s had a month of this year
  Tbf she was antibody positive in June then swab positive again two weeks ago lol
  Actually got it twice
  Chicken pox party 🥰
  That’s the equivalent of 1 coronavirus
  But then you make twice as much?
  Nice
  See him down in cellar on a Tuesday in 40 years
  I just had my flu jab
  So probably safe from everything
  Apart from autism :(
  Oh cool is Jordan byles coming too?
  ☹️
  Gosh that sucks!
  I mean, def not a good comparison, but still...
  I’d hope that would be part of the outfit
  Tom usually does a good job
  Vecchione not Bailey 😂😂
  Yeah we do!

  What?! It was a nice present!
  And no it’s to come visit me

  Well, scratch cards, but I actually got him something awesome but it never arrived
  Got fleeced £25 by a dodgy website
  No!

  You’ve got two more visits to see me
  You could come once
  I’m working 8-9 so good luck
  Have fun with that 😂
  Would take as long for you to get there as me pretty much

  All good
  I used to watch South Park with Katie! She loved it
  Good baby show
  I always wondered about it
  But the up tight professors are too scared to put it on the curriculum

  See what I sent you on instagram josh?
  You’re only an hour behind me!
  That is the worst thing I’ve ever seen
  Yeah
  Didn’t like it
  Animation was bad, plot was boring, stupidly melodramatic
  Just watched the first season
  It’s cheap looking
  If you have to ask you wouldn’t understand
  I’m watching the rugby now
  Goodness gracious makes you proud to be English!
  @447807791328 @447545617918 are you guys proud to be English?
  The wind that shakes the barley
  Prime English beef out on the grass!
  You wouldn’t feel that way if you watched our boys out there right now
  Also everyone speaks your language but you’re not hindered by a silly accent
  I’m an English rose
  Not sure that’s the inclusive view of englishers I want to propitiate
  I’m gonna be watching highlights of this game tonight
  God the only bad thing about watching this is that I can’t be out there with the lads

  Just thinking... why aren’t we having dinner in a pub garden that has a gazebo and heaters?
  I’m busy
  God if I become tier three tomorrow I probably shouldn’t come
  Think steak place will be open?
  yeah 😈
  Let's ask them to put some covers up
  Or we could deliveroo the steak to a different pub that has covers
  They like us there
  Yeah I'd say we should
  sounds gucci
  Yeah!
  8:30-10 then tumbling bay fire, prepped beforehand and covered with a rain-safe tarp

  Vitamin D probably more useful
  Get a flight south of the equator
  You’ll be right as rain by February
  Lol
  I’d have a towel over my shoulders and a vitamin D fortified milkshake to sip on as the UV-filtered-but-still-vitamin-D-replay sunshine coursed over my skin through the glass floor to ceiling walls
  Repleat* fuck

  You’d do even more damage than a Pete and Jack special on your mum’s walls
  Sounded cheekier than I meant it too 😂😂
  Sounds like a nice outfit
  I remember him when you said about the running
  Hope he was still head down sprinting
  Then your head was held high and you were happy

  He wore through the screen of an iPad with his finger swipes
  And has three iPads on at a time
  Yep
  And I said have you thought of playing console games
  And he said he had given them up cause they were too addictive
  He was over
  Hmmm

  You’re riding that red bike for the next five years minimum

  Dress like the price you want 👌
  Have you got one Parry?
  Paul Frank*
  You want it to billow like a renaissance gentleman who can afford as much fabric as he damn wants. I’d say large
  That’s the good stuff for sure

  Some people in this group need to read this:
  😧
  Maggie better
  Just got my second dose
  Feeling powerful
  No she does
  She’s not afraid to be honest with him
  Get angry with him
  Respect him enough to know when he needs to hear the truth. A responsibility born from a life together
  Do you think someone who’s 95% protected from going to ITU or dying from Covid could be ‘wrong’
  My life is risk
  Yeah don’t show Mike he’d die of jealousy
  Little huff of effort after the fact
  lol this is funny
  With traffic took half an hour from Botley road to Kidlington. Already not a big fan of the move

  Lol
  Bye bye!
  Gonna have to get him an extra long paddle
  1917 with Tom Hardy flying over the beaches at Normandy
  That would be the best film
  Then Harry Styles singing sign of the times as the credits roll
  Get Brad Pitt on a conference call - he’ll need his crew from Fury for a five minute tank battle cut scene over the boring singing bit from 1917
  God he was really zoning out at the start of this
  Clever guy though
  Also I’ve been at work all day that’s why I didn’t respond

  If Jack did wet Irish raps I’d do my best to stop it

  Bad man
  Hmmm

  Now just have to wait and see I guess
  Okay I’ll play them off against each other
  Does rusty bike do food?
  Could you get the steak from the Chester to the rusty bike?
  Can both our dogs come to the rusty bike on the same way they’d be welcomed at the Chester?
  Roofs?
  I asked to book a table ‘in one of your sheds’
  So should be fine

  You’re gonna get eaten
  Bump ^

  They’re bringing in a visiting professor of hand surgery to perform the operation
  Straight from London
  All professors of surgery have to start somewhere
  You’re gonna have to post in the telegram groups that you can’t afford surgery now your dog coin has crashed
  Sam found a place in Oxford that does arse waxes
  If bo wants the address
  I saw a toilet with water arse spray

  Cutya is jonesing for some action

  That’s cheating
  I only grow my grass from seed
  Who’s garden is it?
  Knew he’d slam the cryptos
  God that kid’s an animal
  That cast is a bit extra
  Doesn’t look like minimum wage to me tbf
  Cool Bailey let’s him exercise in his gym
  Yeah seen it already m8
  England v Romania?
  Jesus
  I hate both those people
  I hope they both punch each other to death at the same time, like the skeletons in the Williams Bradley production of Jason and the Argonauts
  Glad I missed the fight by the sounds of it
  I put one hundred large on Logan Paul to get concussed by a body shot
  I’m glad I’m not funny to you Logan Paul fans
  You can just draw pictures for us
  I love nagrand
  If I had my way wow would be nagrand with the occasional quests in winterspring
  Even Jhon Bott could manage it
  (Only got to 67 though 😶)
  Cutya can give you some boosts
  37
  Rogue, incredibly powerful one
  Jesus
  Wish I’d got to do that head fix
  I thought he was on holiday with you
  Wagie wagie get in cagey
  lol fuck me
  it's season 1-8 of Hustle
  lol
  we've sent three guesses
  Yeah, I can hear the whistle blowing 1000 miles
  Yeah I thought about wandering round the campsite to hit it, but then I realised I’d have to walk 3x what Josh manages in an average day and even that seemed too much
  Big if true
  41,000 steps an hour
  For 24 hours
  https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/other/thane-man-walked-1-lakh-steps-in-home-in-just-a-day/amp_articleshow/79162090.cms
  I think this is fake
  Seven hundred steps a minute. That’s impossible
  Disappointed in you Parry
  Too busy laughing
  Horrible
  My dad bought a Tesla
  I heard so, in less than 2 seconds too
  Yep
  Didn’t want one but went on a test drive just to see and then bought it
  Nah model 3
  I assume that’s the least fancy?
  I hope we all can
  Blow through some brick walls
  Haha
  Yeah they’ll probs let you do your lessons in it
  God since Connor got hit by that train I really respect the yellow line more
  His face got mashed to make the world safer for all of us 💕
  Really good one though
  If that doesn’t get you an invite I don’t know what will
  Heard it’s based on jhonners and baileys night in the clink
  Just come back 25-30 here 😎
  Rowe’s gonna go to university where I’m living at the time so he can babysit my new born
  (And first born)
  Two 75 year old dads, josh great grandad
  God I’m really into the GIFs today
  Metal testicles
  Pumping out genetically enhanced sperm made by Sam
  Freeze whatever you like when it’s metal
  Yeah did it for a while a year or two ago
  quick results in terms of looking way more scrawny
  You just look swol
  No felt hungry and hypoglyc grumpy
  I did feel better that the pouchy fat on my man lumps quickly disappeared
  Sometimes at work I feel like skipping breakfast makes me more concentrated. But I think that’s just having the motivation to get lunch forces me to get everything done
  Did 5 and 2 for a while as well
  That was awesome
  No cause five days a week you had two full englishes before 8am
  Then ice cream and burgers all day till a ten course dinner
  No I did nothing on 2 days then everything 5 days
  Breast is best
  Fuck me
  Love it
  Rafe didn’t eat for like 3 and a half weeks once
  Just to see how long he could go
  Maybe just twenty days actually
  But yeah, crazy
  Said after 5 days he felt great for a while
  Then really bad and wanted food
  Big if true
  Parry do you think you’re going to have a hot girl summer?
  He had teas
  And black coffee
  When you get that fear-hump
  You could’ve died
  Fuck I hate cows fuck!
  Had some that waited till I had walked past then ran at me and would stop when I turned round
  Did shouting at them work? I need strategies
  Okay nice
  He did get humpy
  That’s an instinct
  Not sure what type
  🦄
  That’s why I take some tangfastics with all my meals
  Prison one?
  might as well never eat again
  total solar eclipse right there
  v rare
  Yours is an orange juice
  Watching that Sean Bean thing
  Perfect for bleeding heart liberals like me, thanks @447934346861
  I thought we’d decided the dog wasn’t wearing and we were done
  I walk this dog sometimes
  Lost without me 🥰
  God that prison show is making me feel bad
  No one should go to prison! Except bullies!
  Fuck, boromir thought he had it had
  Bad*
  Do! Just poke yourself in the eye instead!
  But is great show 5* performances, hard hitting, great drama
  This is old house right jibber?
  Honneur
  Honnêtement
  Fuck!
  Jo
  nner
  I don’t have a tv stand like that in my prison cell
  Yeah you don’t stay in Birmingham if you can help it, that’s for sure
  Birminghohum, that’s what I call it
  Bump
  I’m in Newcastle
  Bump
  Dan saxton
  Lol
  What happened in the end?
  Kind of got left on a cliff hanger
  yeah i bet it is
  if Covid spreads anywhere it's definitely at cricket 🤢
  Fuck me
  Lol
  Lol
  Who’s watching the azzuri boys
  They’re my pool team
  £75 if they win
  quindi ora sono italiano
  Go on Tom
  Stay away you Turk!
  Hand looks like it’s working well
  Looks like it came out Tom’s butt
  Least it probably smells good with that toilet cleaner
  Well don’t drink ocean water if arty’s anything to go by!
  As long as I’ve got google handy I’ve got the only tool I need
  Definitely not gluten
  Fuck people who say you can’t eat gluten
  Like 0.01% of people can’t eat gluten and then the rest of everyone is moaners
  Also age 60 years
  All old people are constipated, that’s what I’ve learnt
  That’s cause of the placebo effect
  No there isn’t
  My favourite quote?
  Lol
  “Some doctors have begun to approve and even recommend a gluten-free diet. "Ultimately, we're here not to do science, but to improve quality of life," says Alessio Fasano, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who has studied NCGS and written a book on living gluten-free. "If I have to throw bones on the ground and look at the moon to make somebody better, even if I don't understand what that means, I'll do it."”
  It’s actually a ‘nocebo’
  You can lie to yourself in any way you want
  I just don’t like to see you spreading lies in a public forum
  That’s it Tom
  You should get Arty on the diet
  Low blow
  Local man eats whole load of bread cures diarrhea worldwide
  New to the area Italian baker receives plaudits with I-only-eata-da-breada approach to dieting
  That’s going to kill Tom Bailey :(
  Squeaky bum time eh josh?
  Woof
  No coming back from that
  Lol
  It’s all gonna come back the other way
  Find at the sphincter it can’t get down so fifty feet back the other way and out the throat
  I’ve seen it before
  Never in one so young
  Yeah bet you’re safe
  Maybe not safe from social embarrassment
  🥰🥲
  Those commentators are optimistic and kind
  Just the way I like it
  Evie’s at tap social if you’re looking
  He’s gonna score 3
  Bet the Australians were chuffed their minders are up
  I never had any doubt
  Arguably making fun of racists
  Lol
  Where’d he go
  He’s left twice
  Meme nerves
  I know the feeling
  I send a popping GIF to you guys
  It doesn’t get so much as a ‘lol’
  Devastated
  Can’t imagine how bad it’d be if I’d made it myself
  And it was that shit
  Fuuuuck
  I’d run straight at that poster and dive in
  I’ve printed out your photo on poster peler
  Paper*
  How was nagrand?
  Seems the only sensible thing to do
  Maybe get to 68/69 first
  lol
  why did he leave?
  was he confused?
  hmm
  I don't _want_ to invite him back in
  but I guess I have to
  lol
  don't think he'll see
  hopefully
  Especially the way Jonner went in on him for 24 straight hours
  shit sorry wrong chat
  made the great fire of london look like a mild first degree scalding
  especially as anniversary of Grenfell is today
  I guess that's what Josh brings to the group
  Why did you leave?
  I'm changing the group firstly cause it was annoying not to see T10, and secondly as a punishment for you leacing
  nah it's class
  great football
  lol that shot
  Has anyone just bought dominoes
  £26 just came off my card for dominos and I wondered if I’d left my card details on any computer
  (You’d be welcome to it _obviously_)
  Nah it was online
  Interest on that should mean there's 800g for everyone
  I like standing and looking out of windows thoughtfully
  So chair def blocked by tv for me
  I’m skinny
  Tv blocking my access to chair
  Maybe you can steal a kiss when the lights go down 😉
  It’s taken so much longer than I thought. Never would’ve done it if I’d known
  Lol
  My gran and grandad had one
  Day after they sold it it was used in a robbery
  They came to arrest my granddad
  Did 10 years
  Played poker with the Kray twins’ lawyer
  Wouldn’t have a face any more
  You said it
  You told my dad you couldn’t do jobs in Kidlington
  Glad the kids’ll get to soccer practice on time
  He’s such a sub
  Lol
  Better keep that footage under wraps
  Don’t want people to know he’s not scary
  Stuck in London :(
  Tap social was alright in World Cup
  Tap you can throw your beers in the air and say ‘that’s it England!’ when they score 🙂
  Settles me nerves
  Then Scotland have surprise gareth bale sub in second
  Prefer to come through second anyway
  You were right Tom! It’s all an inside job
  Loved it
  Good solid football
  He did it!
  I can see Cutya at the bottom <\3
  Lol
  He still hasn’t deleted it yet
  Maybe he’s just tired of it all and this is his resignation letter
  Can only delete for myself, and that’s the last person I want to delete it for
  He stole my thunder
  Yeah no one said a good time was illegal
  I hope it is
  God my guy Al needs one of those
  I worked with him for four months. He went on holiday instead of working during coming , and is training to be a GP cause he thinks it’s all a bit shit
  Lol
  Make a little money off him
  Covid*
  Power play
  I mean, you’d be hard pressed to get it into wider circulation than he’s managed
  Seen the video?
  I think it’s the ultime essence of Australians
  Ultimate *
  Oh, I know
  Lol
  Haha
  On call 24 hrs
  I like Butter by BTS
  Song of the century
  Some say
  I don't think I will sorry :(
  Big if true

  Oh, did they say why?
  That’s good I gueS
  Lol
  You’ll never guess this local Oxford man’s one tip to tendon fix
  Yeah 🥲
  Like middle of the evening
  Let everyone get a look I suppose
  Lol
  I wonder how many days in a row I could do it for
  Yeah he’s bottle me
  lol
  def was a spliff
  bump
  gonna quit my job, have some piff and a peroni at the park, then free britney
  Good that they def weren't gonna get the wrong hand
  Had they consented you
  lol
  he's not a real doctor
  that belly gonna go in 1
  So, my dad wants to give me his Mini now he has his Tesla. But I'm gonna be away in Canada August and September, and won't need it to commute from October cause you can't really drive into Chelsea every day. Should I just sell it for £6000? The only insurance that isn't crazy expensive are the black box ones, has anyone ever done that?
  haha was gonna ask. Yeah will def pay you
  lol
  This is my main thought. If I'm not commuting, the only thing I need a car for would be fun things, and I think I can remove those from my life
  MOTEL 3 BABY!
  I think epileptics can drive automatic's tbh
  Bullish on Van
  I'm gonna NFT Vecchione's van and then it will be mine
  I'm gonna be away August and September
  but I probably wouldn't give you the keys
  cause I trust you about as far as I can throw you
  yeah, this sounds better
  You do say this, don’t you
  True, can’t vote red with those property taxes
  Fuck that’s pretty good
  Tell the blues to win
  £75 riding on it
  Basically a home game for the Italians
  Goal ruled out!
  Love VAR
  helps with fluidity and fun
  Squeaky bum time
  You can grab a jab your second! Or at least you can at the one our hospital has set up, so worth checking

  In a capitalist system the only way trees get planted is if there’s a demand for paper once they’re fully grown. At least that way they remove CO2 for a fair amount of time
  Buy as much paper as possible and just chuck it i say

  David McIver watch out!
  Put his dream to bed 🥲
  Lol
  I’m having a look
  No recent posts on his website
  For the two men who found josh mccaffer, this should be easy
  God that’s a comedy death knell
  I didn't know he wrote prose poetry in sixth form
  I didn't know there was an after school club for writing!
  I think he's telling lies
  Yeah haven't heard the topman bit
  He said he gets good grades 😬
  Wait am I listening to a different one?
  Ellie eveleigh :)
  I'm on I Adore To Write
  I followed the link to that one
  What's the right one called?
  There's one called 'there were 7 of us'
  Is that about us and not him :)
  god I'm on to track 2
  I can't stop!
  I think I can actually, getting a bit boring
  if you make a wry comment on your narcissism, then make an hour long album about yourself, I'm pretty sure it cancels out
  I haven't even got to Morgan yet! This is BS!
  who's the driving test guy?
  Is that Parry?
  Becki... Must be Heather
  apparently this is for a live show
  if i was at a live show and this is what was playing

  Sorry Dave

  Was Giannis playing?
  He actually plays for Greece oops nvm
  Quitter
  Staycation with the lads?
  That pigeon looks healthier than any pigeon I've ever seen
  haha
  And also, bird sanctuaries need defunding if they have the capacity to help pigeons
  I'd say channel it into exterminating pigeons
  Yeah I'm really pissed off about this situation
  I need a holiday
  Luckily I have somewhere to stay
  Table tennis?
  Marks out of 10?
  Papped in all the major newspapers
  The initial reviews are fab!
  The only film I watch is the lord of the rings extended edition
  I write for schitt’s creek
  I know quite a few OTs
  Can give you some good lines
  “When can Doris go home?”
  “Is the key safe in for bed 23?”
  Nothing as exciting as epipens for me or the OTs
  Sadie’s sister is 21 and thought it was called Fiza
  Think it’s new marketing to get the kids to take it
  Light of my life, fire of my loins
  Good for the garden
  I did 4 night shifts after my vaccine
  Cars are a global disease
  Bicycles maybe even worse tbh
  Have to spend 14 days in the Caribbean first
  Tried watching the surfing
  I’m just watching a guy get ducked by a load of waves
  Fucked *
  Every does that when it’s their olympics. Like how there was 157 sailing events at London
  Sometimes the commentators call them Russia and it makes me mad
  It’s been a laugh riot
  I sent screenshots to an ITV exec, and they want us to have our own breakfast show
  I thought I was gonna get all the way through
  Stopped at episode 3
  Fuck!
  Glad Ross will live to joke again
  I’ve been doing milkshake tastings for years
  Haven’t had one in ages though
  Fuck Covid !
  Horrible to watch
  Bbc podcast def next best thing

  Don’t think I read all of them
  Maybe I will now
  I liked it when he can’t marry his half sister
  I’m watching the women’s weightlifting
  GB gonna beat them this time round
  I watched England play Fiji at twice ham
  GB #1
  Fiji #2
  Turkmenistan big on the women’s lifting scene
  Canadian team best I heard
  #1a
  Bad luck Jack
  Australia are losing
  fuuuuuuuck
  Dont do it!
  Excited
  Almost as excited watching the replay of Liam Brody getting into the last 32
  Fiji got a holiday last time they won gold medal!
  I kind of want them to win again
  Lol
  New Zealand in semis
  Fiji in final
  At the end of the day it’s about who wants it more
  I like them
  Give me the full picture
  As a sport acrobatist*
  Is he feeding the grass instead of the ducks?
  Was wondering about this
  Simone looks nervous
  Ask him if he’s still on the circuit
  Lol
  I’m gonna message to say Jonner’s serving a libel suit for suggesting Morgan banged Ellie
  🤤
  yeah found her
  Yeah got he was in for a long time
  Then I bumped into him in London
  I watched Cheer
  Def the only issue
  I don’t think the film the team gymnastics very well
  I have no fucking idea what’s going on
  Josh loved the sports acrobatics version
  Less exciting, less well attended, still as painful
  Lived*
  Fuck autocorrect!
  Yeah, that was good
  She’s gone!
  Mum picked her up I guess
  Few
  Simone Back
  Runny botty?
  Yeah, this
  Had to go poop
  Lol
  That gets the big points
  Proof’s in the pudding
  Shame about Simone
  She’s having a little dance as well
  Looks just like one of the other GB team
  They say why?
  Definitely a runny tummy issue
  A Paula Radcliffe special I’m afraid
  Too sexy
  What place are GB now?
  Still 7th?
  It’s been listening to Akon on repeat for 3 months
  I love it
  Good sport
  Fuck, GB got gymnastics bronze
  god all these medals
  triggering me
  cause Luke Botham still has mine
  nope
  but i only got silver
  you up late Jack
  fuuuuck
  Simone said why she didn’t want to continue
  “After the performance I did I just didn’t want to go on.”
  I don’t know how I’m gonna look my kids in the eye
  And tell them their hero’s a quitter
  Haha
  That would be a crazy dinner party
  The kids crying
  She’s only 4ft 8 so Jack shouting down at her would be _super_ uncomfortable as well
  Lol
  Terrible thing to have to do 😓
  Oh you know it
  I’m in
  In the bronze medal match?
  It would be illegal to destroy that artwork
  Basically a license to print money
  The machines can be used for help with pores and scars too
  I’ll do a day course in fillers and Botox, and we can run a full on aesthetics outfit
  I already have a Brazilian bum lift bum
  Maybe I should do a butt transplant
  Nice, I’ll charge enough for josh to get his tattoo removal machine
  Man’s done his research
  We can just hang my medical degree up in Rowe’s bedroom and I’ll take him to the park while josh does his botched removals
  I liked Call T by your Ten :(
  https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/online-blended-learning/courses/13028/pgcert-skin-ageing-and-aesthetic-medicine/?gclid=CjwKCAjwgISIBhBfEiwALE19SSEZPEyqdukqguazyrJqhAiSrFmMr4YQJKuLycK4_6LHYxS895o7nxoCmkIQAvD_BwE
  I need our investors to give me 5k to go on this course
  (Arguably a better investment than your machine)
  Haha it is a pyramid scheme!
  Horse torture really he’s too big to guys
  Fuck pug racing would be a good Olympic sport
  50 pugs per chariot
  Hmm
  As long as you make sure all the pugs are friends
  GB might get bronze
  Take 4 or 5 women to the same showing
  Person who gives it the most stars gets a second date
  And that’s the sign
  They’d all be really impressed as well
  You’d look like a massive Chad
  Just whisper ‘they’re my sisters’ to each girl when the others aren’t looking
  “Uuuhh, I’ve just got a weak bladder”
  I do that a lot at my mum’s house
  But luckily I’m the only one who uses the shower
  You stole my mum’s white wine
  And the sweet lips of a European nanny
  Amber Maslen 6th in the country at canoe slalom
  But only top 2 went to Tokyo 🥲
  Over the hill
  Lol
  Sexually attractive to Josh
  I fancy hazel bleats
  Blears
  😋
  Lol
  Lol
  Hope he got some of his breakfast in his mouth 😂😂
  All Australian track team isolating
  Yeah it’s kind of funny - I saw lots of people die from blood clots in their lungs with Covid, but have never seen anyone with a blood clot from Astra zeneca (though their is a mechanism known for how AZ can cause clots in a strange way)
  I think what they mean by saying you’re at similar risk from clots from AZ as Pfizer is that if you look at 100s of 1000s of people who have taken both, the clot rates are similar cause AZ causes so few
  Yeah it leaves itself open for criticism by suggesting AZ doesn’t cause a unique type of clots, cause it does
  Amber Maslen!
  34 🥲
  I mean, the whole Russian team has to have a pretend name cause of their doping
  In Germany they did a celebrity tv show to see who would get on the luge team and then they won a bronze or something in 4 years
  Let’s be honest Josh, your only real chance is channeling all your own failures into your son in the hope that he can be an Olympian
  Lol
  This table tennis crazy!
  Almost as crazy as the American commentator who keeps saying the Chinese player has ‘dragon breath’
  Glad the Chinese guy won
  Missing Simone this morning
  I was giving snaps for this!
  What’s more in agreement than snaps!
  😮
  Gonna need to drive pretty slow with that attached

  To show I can see you all
  And also the Canadian authorities
  Oh shit I need to find your pillowcases to deserve that
  You need pick to parry?
  Okay lol
  Do you need me to bring food?
  That’s subtle
  Lifetime ban from the William Morris :(
  Kind of crazy getting banned after 3 pints
  Definitely the least I’ve ever drunk there
  Should’ve done, after the smoke rings we were blowing
  Three pints for less than £10
  It’s daylight robbery
  Haha
  Kind of helping him
  Think Artie would eat those meat sticks till he died?
  He showed no sign of stopping with me though
  That’ll do it
  Just left for the airport
  Phoebe tried to use a glue gun with just the plastic tube and asked me why it wasn’t working
  Haha
  I like the polka dot man
  Isn’t it like 50/50?
  I watched judus and the black messiah on the plane
  I don’t throw this around much, but I might say… _5 stars_
  You should
  Also saw a quiet place 2
  _3 stars_!
  Yeah I think that makes sense
  Quite in sync
  We should start our own review website
  JjsaysPEsays
  Much better
  Well, I guess it wasn’t five stars, so now I don’t have much wiggle room
  Yeah 4* for me too
  Think India in red list still so 10 days of quarantine q a lot for even a 96% RT film
  Do it. Let time slip away in a meaningless blur.

  Could’ve made it into a tiktok
  You on same continent as me yet?
  Fuck!
  Congrats Tom 🦄🦄
  There’s no ying without yang 🥲
  People who are self righteous about animals are my least favorite people
  People who throw sticks at cows and then pretend they love animals? Almost as bad
  I like cocks that fight other cocks
  Fuck I miss him. Looking at him just makes me hate breeders and people who apparently go round parks stealing dogs!
  Damn I’m becoming one of them
  Love it
  Glow up
  Oh it’s a new weed drink you can buy
  Meant to get you high
  Tastes like fizzy water with weed in
  Close your eyes and you can pretend it’s lemony
  The ‘grapefruit’ is a stretch
  No but I could persuade myself I felt something 3/4 of the way through
  That’s how you get married mate
  Oh, I thought you were talking about Tom 😂

  Phone screen must look 🔥
  They let me use my name this time 😎
  😻
  Makes you wonder why everyone doesn’t do this with their cars
  No, I’m pretty sure channel 4 presenters have fantastical wealth
  I’m trying to manifest want i want to be real, rather than expressing what is currently real
  Wooft that was a whirlwind
  Sounds like everything went well though
  Overall
  And I wouldn’t leave Josh! Always helpful to have an organisation behind you when mishaps happen
  Insert astronaut in space with gun meme
  That’s the one!

  They shouldn’t make babies go to work that early
  They need more sleep
  Yeah she’s good I had some pie for dessert
  She had*
  Yeah it’s annoying
  Mostly for me
  Yeah that bit’s fab
  Yeah the Canadian healthcare system is going to have some _very_ pointed articles directed it’s way
  Ty 🦄
  Thanks, think he should be fine. A mild version of the type of stroke that causes locked in syndrome, so that’s a good miss
  🔥
  Wouldn’t load for me
  People love a good moan
  🥰

  On first day of work

  I think I’m going to die
  Don’t get vaccinated guys
  I don’t know
  It feels like last time but worse
  So probably the combo

  Don’t know if this one vaccine or not 🥲
  You’re late

  Fuck!
  Fuuuuck! I love Phil Taylor!
  First time you’ve used that word correctly
  Hahahaaaaaa
  Man down
  Lol
  Josh, Nicola had a sister called Lara in Naomi’s year
  But she doesn’t know her second name
  What really?
  Hmm
  I wanted weirder so more likely to find
  Still same person?
  Hmmm
  I don’t remember
  That isn’t what I’d be messaging Mrs Whyles about if I added her 😈
  She did
  And sadness
  Lonely sadness disease
  There was a girl at our primary school
  Who was so shy she’d cry when you talked to her
  She hid under tables
  Just to hide from human eyes
  Once she took my pencil
  And I said can I have it back
  And she cried and ran out of the classroom
  Now we’re trying to find her
  So I can make it up to her
  And we can film a feel good documentary about two young men forming a mid life bond with a woman with selective mutism
  It’s going to be called Selective Mutualism
  That’s pretty good
  God I just did one and it was too mean
  Couldn’t send it
  It was like Nicola Williams was on camera
  Now my mum’s in the room so I can’t make fun of people with difficulties
  You don’t think…
  Maybe she was Benjamin button-ing
  Before our eyes
  The Curious Case of Bicola Billiams
  :)
  Pete Seeger?
  You are beautiful
  Even I can’t say the third one is good
  Second one is awesome though
  Jeez it’s really amping up
  Insulate Britain protesters are sitting in a road and a fat young man flicks ink on their faces
  hehe
  Maybe the t10 should do something about it
  finally solve this climate mess
  Why did you do that?
  It won’t be fun if you do
  Fuck! Might be busy
  I was very explicit not to
  Hopefully he’s doing too much Coke in London
  I couldn’t have been more explicit
  Are ‘wives’ invited?
  went to one with jack in the US
  it was quite dirty
  like if McDonald's hadn't done any of its fake we're-healthy-now stuff over the last 20 years
  but uk version might be different
  there was a large spotty boy and I think his mum off a highway in the Maine wilderness
  they probably hunted the cows themselves
  lol
  god if it's Mike you def can't go
  haha
  it's weird with burgers cause if you're a connoisseur of a food type, maybe that means your standards are too high. But if you 'love burgers' I think it's just a race to the bottom
  so you probably shouldn't go
  you def have a more discerning sophie pallett
  no can you go and take pictures plz?
  yeah do that
  that's a good choice
  It’s 11a.m.!
  What were you doing?
  Too scary for me tbh
  Beethoven couldn’t hear when he died

  Good friend of mine
  Hello Tom you are up early
  You are on a night out aren’t you
  You are I can tell
  I’m a doctor

  It seems fucking insane that Sony can’t make PlayStations quick enough
  That’s smart
  I’m dum
  Having a job and all
  The doctor I’m with tonight has a crypto education startup with her partner
  They teach people to trade
  I told her I was a crypto wizard
  Shit coin shiller
  She advised me to get into Eth when it was $70
  Yeah but you need the money from the Eth to build it 😬
  You going?
  Lol
  Shouldn’t be allowed!
  They’ll go the way of the bikes
  Don’t like that
  Trying keep a grip of my work this week like
  Not the best we’ve been sent
  But! Not the worst! 🙂

  You do need your blood powering your other muscles
  I’ve been listening to some audiobooks recently

  Me and Bailey liked the silmarillion in primary school
  Though I think he just pretended to read it

  dan radford my favourite of the undesirables that josh has brought near me in the last 10 years
  compared to fionn? much better
  Maybe you shouldn’t have FUCKING INVITED HIM!!!!
  FUUUUCCCCCKKKK
  It really is!
  But full of fun for us
  HEY
  I didn’t work my arse of in teldrassil to not adventure with my fellow adventurers

  I wish there was more of these in the group
  His job sounds exciting
  Artie should be wearing a mask
  Did you get killed by the horse Jack?
  Horde
  One love for sure

  Timothee Chalamet made it tiger striped for him

  The Oxford tube is more expensive than the train now
  Sad day
  It will be!
  Though they do have jazzy new buses
  My night elf died
  Went into a cave with a guy who aggroed everyone
  I was gonna try gnome
  Can gnomes be priests?
  Everyone knows gnomes are the easiest cause they’re hardest to click on
  Two dwarf paladins
  Brothers and rivals
  Are you still alive Josh?
  What’s wrong with him?
  There are no such thing as qualms in drunk Bailey mind
  I won’t be going if there is ANY risk of harm
  To my patients
  My friends
  Or my family
  I’ve actually got loads of other offers. So Josh you have to promise me it will be super fun. The practical action you have to take with this promise is to uninvite Fionn
  Say an unnamed partygoer is refusing to attend if he does
  Lol
  I’m more paranoid than you
  I’m going to bring Dave mciver
  I didn’t want to watch that
  if it was an NFT everyone could just look at it in their own time on their own
  ?
  of course
  Uncanny!
  Fuck that’s a good one
  Huge glow up
  How he die??
  Oh dear!
  I only really wear Christmas jumpers anyway
  https://twitter.com/davelee1968/status/1464524211339382786?s=21
  no it is magical
  you need to take a good hard look at yourself and see if calling a video that proves the existence of the world being a fundamentally beautiful place is, to you, some 'fake shit'
  I don't actually have one </3
  if Tom can knit us all sustainably sourced woolly jumpers I will wear one
  Hate ‘em
  Plain only please
  I’m poorsche
  Your sadness doesn’t trump my truth
  That’s worse than a helicopter ☹️
  He has a potty mouth!
  Rude children should be hit and not heard
  Though that’s actually illegal now I think
  Dave in accounts slowly sidled up to her… “fancy a leg over love?” He purred adoringly.
  Nice baby
  That’s pretty good
  Lol
  Laughing at the reply not the events (obvs)
  Break ups always hard sending love 💕

  Ded
  Oh so you prove your racist stereotypes?
  That will be nice 🙂

  Say Free A$AP to her
  Shows you’ve got cool mates, and you can show her Josh’s messages to show how funny we are too
  Always good advice
  People love that
  Touch her hair to show you’re tactile
  Just got my new lips and nose, hadn’t settled down yet
  I hope it’s returned on your blood test that’s my thoughts
  Yeah I don’t care sorry
  I guess Lake District must be slim pickings
  Too far
  There you go
  That’s my knees
  He swerved to the left when in he couldn’t help sniffing his right index
  Quite a few people actually
  Bailey used to do dances for the whole maths block
  He’s definitely a bottom
  Bailey
  Bumbling
  Bad at science
  Barking mad
  God he’s all the Bad B’s
  Shit on him all you want
  Bailey’s the one who doesn’t read the chat
  Yeah Jesus denny
  I think you’re going to hell
  Sounds like you should keep arguing with her in that case
  Bad eggs
  Ah
  Australian lady or the other one?
  Did the Russian lady try and touch your bad place?
  Oh I don’t think I know your Australian train rape story. Sounds like you were fighting the good fight though
  Wait the turkey one?
  Damn this is interesting!
  This poll is no longer available.
  I’m at work the first weekend so probably not going to have a housewarming
  Can’t wait
  Sad!
  You think Bailey would come?
  I need to be the main event
  Hmm, not how the present works
  As in tomorrow?
  That was a nice card!
  like, hamburgers are hamburgers, not meatballs
  I don't think it's a very good joke
  Both of mine
  I think mine probably blew it out of the water
  BANGBURY!!!
  What do people from Oxfordshire call a city full of brothels?
  Ok I’ll try and think of a version for you
  Joke^
  It’s kind of a London home
  👶
  CANADA WATER!!!
  What do Londoners call maple syrup?
  I’ve got a joke
  I was about to tease you about that probably being an Addison Lee
  Feel like it’s a more authentic way of living
  I always have my AirPods in these days
  That’s better
  I’m removing your messages
  Woah
  Love him to death
  Oh shit he’s lurking
  Will help me not get pissed at denny
  That’s quite calming
  Doctor $ changed the chat theme.
  This is good shit
  Ooh baby
  Doctor $ changed the chat theme.
  Back to orange plz
  Oh yeah no
  I liked it
  FUUUUUEERRGGERRDEEEGERRR
  ‘I showed her the ring yeah but nah I didn’t ask her but yeah we ain’t getting married’
  It feels like you asked her Josh and she said no
  Lol
  Only married people deserve t shirts that prestigious
  I knew wow was finally retro cool!
  👶
  Should’ve given it to granny in a napkin
  Nice!
  On your own if your bedroom?
  Damn I’m jealous
  What type?
  Jesus
  Got any booboos on face?
  What about BREATHING?!!??
  And there’s a lot of it!
  That silicon will leak into your brain
  Crackin pair o’ knockaz!
  Who’s number 1 at the back? Sophie?
  Photo veterans!
  Nice thumbs up and peace sign from me and parry
  That’s nice!
  After*
  And a hard fought campaign
  We did but no I think he came second
  Best in sixth form
  That’s why they had him scraping gravel for the entire 2 weeks
  He tried with Bailey but Bailey said no
  I did a photo shoot with that man at Blenheim palace
  And if you got it on that basically counts anyway
  That’s ok Josh I understand
  Shut up you siren
  1L already today
  I’m actually doing quite well
  How was yesterday @Josh Williams Bradley
  Sun a bit too much sometimes
  I’m sleepy
  Definitely from mature ladies
  Do it if you want
  Bottom line
  I’d say
  Best reason to get married
  Oh wait, maybe you don’t
  You know best
  Sad :(
  Why would I give away my hard won knowledge?
  (Lowercase d)
  Pusha d
  But also, propose you dummy!
  Everyone’s topless here Josh you’d like it
  Need that kind of commitment
  Thanks for the link Jhon B
  Do you think breaking the seal only happens with alcohol? Or if you went crazy on water it would be the same?
  Powerful
  Ooh yh maybe that’s what I was thinking
  And I’ll be in Spainwith you 💖
  July 11th in 2 days
  True
  Hmmm no swear it was black & red. Maybe I’m make believing again
  Josh what happened to your black bike with red wheels?
  You’re practically in outland
  I always thought Russian homophobia was western propaganda but I guess I was wrong
  (To translation)
  Lol
  I’m so psyched
  In with the burns just when you promise to never extinguish a house fire
  god he’s like a house fire
  FUUUUUCK
  Oh put your money where your mouth is some time denny
  Nah just tell his daughter your marrying his parents
  Yeah tbf we probably shouldn’t be having this conversation without the lived experience of some of our Irish brethren
  Gods plan
  Tell that to every single mammal that couples with one other animal and never cheats and is never gay
  Not judging Josh, just you
  If you’re talking to parents first you’re conforming to a tradition of talking to parents to get permission, which seems gross
  denny out
  In pete’s view, it would be a bit weird if a women’s parents and man were talking about her future behind her back without her input
  Fair enough that is respectful
  That’s very old fashioned if you Hosh!
  That lady seems tall
  Jonner will be doing the music
  Go f yourself
  Oh shut up denny
  License to THRILL 😮🤤
  Happy birthday! 🥳🥳🥳
  👶
  No you don’t don’t worry
  My grief has wiped my mind
  I don’t remember anything
  Sorry wrong chat
  denny what’s happening??
  I can’t understand you
  Trying to change the subject
  Damn Daniel, that’s all I have to say
  I'd trade one fresh denny for a festering homophobe
  (me to denny)
  harsh but true
  ooft

  wowzers
  Can’t take the punching bag out the gym
  None of that

  Jack’s driving
  Josh will make us fall in
  That would be nicer
  If we really want to punt
  I can maybe get a free one
  NOT!
  Thanks for that denny
  Jonner’s gonna be first two-man of every major raid
  Me on August 27th:
  👶
  With some of my most power aoe spells and some startling dps
  When Josh’s next barrage of hate comes down on you, I’ll be raining it with him
  There’s not much you can do about it now
  Just like your small mind
  From now on you’re going to be denny with a small d
  I was your biggest ally in this chat
  You just pissed me off
  Wow Denny
  That would be so sick
  I went to Sadie’s work drinks once. Someone bought me a beer. I say tinse them for all they’ve got
  Ah, mate, that's prime that is!
  No, josh uses that as an adjective now
  Josh very much a Caligula
  I'd be Claudius
  who'd want to see their shame
  embarrassing for them
  And that belt cam gave you the veneer of a law enforcement officer
  🤤
  Lol
  Nah it’s Tom’s
  Yeah maybe same speed
  Josh would like some feedback on this
  Good worker
  Got him working for me
  Doctor $ changed the group photo.
  Lol
  Josh has to see Big Will Yyonssjeeën
  You’re planning something
  You’re a nasty piece of work
  Wow yeah that was aggressive Denny

  Someone of such a fishy temperament might be able to
  True
  Only thing that could hope to tame my wild spirit
  I’m getting married to the sea

  “Shillingford to Didcot, Oxfordshire:
  The walk: An easy walk with plenty of opportunities to swim in the River Thames, and optional visits to an Iron Age hill fort and a medieval abbey. There are many possible swimming places – the river is quite wide and deep and easy to swim across. The water quality of the Thames at Dicot (Dorchester) is classed as grade 'A' in the latest Environment Agency monitoring data (on a scale of A to E where A is very good and E is bad.”

  The pair each received 15 months imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.

  My memory’s not what it used to be
  Oops 1945 lol
  God it was a slog
  1944

  We can only hope
  He was pissing me off on the weekend for sure
  He’s been quiet for two days I think
  I wonder if Denny does!
  Jonner has LinkedIn :)
  I assume so
  Well

  But I’ll be back in a minute
  Have some stuff I’m finna do
  I’m back June 16th
  Is it just girls now jack?
  That definitely wouldn’t make it smell nice for the mummy!
  I think maybe humans touched the baby so it didn’t smell right for the mummy anymore
  I saw a big lady elk 5 mins before on it’s own looking sad
  If you zoom you can see it, looking all creey
  Well, it was a dying baby elk
  I saw a dead deer too!
  Thought it was josh

  Lol
  I need to watch the raptors
  The fight is boring too
  Fair enough
  I am yep
  Haha we are gang
  You should have the ufc game on too
  Yeah this sucks
  I’m pissed off
  Crazy number of Liverpool fans in the chat

  If you can get it down to Harley Road, jack’s mum’s friend has a good portable jump start
  I don’t like MOTs
  You’re heading home early Jonner
  I like ice hockey

  I saw a roadrunner today!
  He’ll be fine
  Greyhound was late arriving in Albuquerque
  It doesn’t have to be Benidorm
  There are nicer places you could go now you have a passport
  👹
  Sorry
  I don’t think going to Benidorm would be fun at all
  I kept waiting for it to not be about package holidays
  Jesus that was not good
  Hope you’re all voting today guys
  I can’t believe I don’t get to drool of some sexmuffins
  None of these pictures are loading
  I just sent it to all mine too 😉
  (Katrina)
  You know what I’m sayingggg
  They lived in New Orleans so the sea is pretty close to their house
  Yeah I told someone the other day
  That’s the farthest city from the coast in England!! 😂😂😂
  I’ll tell you what, it’s definitely not going to Oxford
  What’s it like?
  @Tom Vecchione you’re on a cruise
  I paid £10 for a carbon neutral fight once so you can do one josh
  HEY
  At the end of that status he said “now my watch is almost over”
  Don’t make me hard!
  Jack everley started working on game of thrones as they started filming season 7. Coincidence? I think NOT
  71 years young
  https://mobile.twitter.com/Schwarzenegger/status/1129805366513025028
  This isn’t the time to talk about York
  Someone kicked Arnold!!
  👶
  Oh god ok York it is
  I don’t know about York
  That poor man
  Shame Jo will have to quit her job so soon :(
  Get married while you’re out there, I love a destination wedding
  Kardashian talking about z-list..
  Very sweaty
  Shadowed him for a month in Lewisham A&E
  We were so tight 💖
  It was Dr Alex Denny
  👶
  I don’t have a friend on this season so I’m not sure I can be bothered
  Lol
  Josh swaps it round for a midnight special
  So not then
  Sunday 26th May we’ll all be at Wembley seeing the Black Cats prompted to the championship with a spicy 1-0 win after extra time
  https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48210117
  This is what I mean by exciting football:
  Champion’s league final? F off
  push out*
  we also touch prolapses
  well that's not all we do in medical school
  You guys should come do some work experience with me
  I'm doing an obstetric placement next year, so I'll be able to help out then!
  probably 5-6 years
  If I went all guns blazing in a quest to perform an abortion as quickly as possible...
  Also josh people called 1/4 black people 'quadroons'
  How's that for a boring answer to your dumb question?
  oh no Denny because the recent decisions by state senates in Georgia and Alabama will be immediately challenged in court, thereby delaying their enactment for the foreseeable future
  In georgia you were black if you were 1/8th or more
  apart from the gay marriage laws I guess
  I found out that 53 years ago we wouldn't have been allowed to marry @Josh Williams Bradley
  dog des kawaiiiii!
  don't let him pretend he likes animals
  Josh throws stones at cows
  plenty of time to brew up a prolapse
  back middle of June
  Oh I'll be there
  I only scavenge deer
  There's a lovely village called froghall nearby
  I guess we've all got to start collecting those soap bottles
  we can play with it
  and Rob will show you his anus at breakfast
  fun place to play football
  I've been
  it's nice there
  where are we going?
  are we partying on a mondya?
  and July 1st is a Monday
  you've missed a lot
  Shame we can't get Jeremy to sort all this strife out
  :o
  Psfhhh like that could happen
  I LOVE SIMPSONS GIFS!!
  J@k 4tt4çk
  J@k
  I love the silly faces Denny, don’t listen to him
  I watched one of the scary movies with you Denny
  We should have saxton-free Saturday afternoons or something
  That was such a nice break
  And we’re back in!
  Yeah I mean he surpassed all my expectations
  It’s like the end of the lord of the rings
  Can’t believe it
  He’s gone
  Lol
  Ill be there
  Josh kick him for a second
  What date is Parry’s?
  Don’t tell the wife Denny!
  I should get into bow ties
  👶
  I’m gonna be in Alabama tomorrow so I can pass on your congratulations
  He tried to hit me once
  Is that actually him?
  Make sure everyone’s working hard like they should be
  I’m in Georgia so I can check on your farms jack
  I’m just gonna watch the battle of the bastards on repeat for 10 years
  Rubble on the head?
  It’s taking a good shlocking from reviewers
  I liked the hound fight
  And Jaime has magic tummy where he can take a good few stabs
  Nice that Euron happened to wash up exactly where Jaime was
  God yeah the scorpions suddenly being useless was weird
  Lol
  Tried to stay positive but that ep was a bit shit
  I guess maybe that’s what mad is though eh?
  Yeah felt like she could’ve gone mad queen and destroyed the city without doing it for absolutely no reason in the moment
  👶
  That’s my congrats-for-learning-a-new skill Parry
  I think ECT
  We have the entire skill set required
  And frame it for all the haters
  They should do the blood test they do for people in hospitals to see if they’re just faking
  I’m a southern belle
  So if anyone has anything racist to say I don’t mind
  I’m in the south
  I miss that spoons
  God that looks like a good night
  Good friends of yours
  I bet you've got some ideas @Dan Saxton
  double threat!
  Then I realise it’s just another faker
  So many people have gotten a big slap on the back and a frothy pint of ale thrusted towards them
  I see you everywhere
  that's a GIF of Brad Marchand, famous for licking other hockey players
  I don't know who Brad is, but I know that's Jaquie P
  That's @Jack Parry
  No me gusta!
  God he sucks balls
  I thought after the leg he couldn’t have any more doctor?
  Why don’t you get one if you love it so much josh?
  All I got is this
  Not friends :(
  Fuck Kamran Choudry’s got nothing for me :(
  Wait I can normally think up some good feedback
  you're getting nothing from me Denny
  it's a friend maker!
  and have a fun and appreciated way to talk to homeless and drunk people
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_ZDQKq2F08
  Oh, I know the truth
  You should make an origami swan shaking its head and with a voice recorder inside repeating “stop smoking Ray!”
  jealous
  favourite film
  I love Snow Piercer!
  You've been picking your nose
  A real man
  They by the same person?
  No but I want to
  American Rust or something?
  And that American book
  I’m going to New York
  No, but my student discount did :(
  I couldn’t support their evil ways any more
  I cancelled my amazon prime subscription
  Oh fuck!
  Lol
  Oh well!
  It’s annoying you seem to have to send it twice
  You can edit GIFs!
  Sending my love
  Good night everyone
  Lol
  Two votes seals it
  Chav
  He never wants to go, but feels like he has to chip in
  Three if you count the office trip Gerry always organises
  Haha
  You think you can retire at 60 when you’re ten children are all at boarding school?
  What a way to make a living
  I think any time you’ve ever ended a call with me world of Warcraft was next on the agenda
  Jhon Bott probably didn’t have his camera on cause he’s still at work
  No one available?
  Didn’t I send it to you a few months ago Jack?
  Sorry J man
  I forgot my headphones
  Doctor $ joined the video chat.
  Doctor $ joined the video chat.
  I had it a while ago...
  And we’ve been able to give him something new and sexy he can play with
  Beyond his clear affinity for digital blackface, i think Denny has few passions in life
  That’s me saying no to racism josh 💖
  (No racial pun intended)
  I think you’re the raccoon josh
  That’s very sweet to call you star lors
  Dr strange has shit gifs
  Yeah d strange bad
  Well I don’t think I’m in love with Denny so I may have to be dr strange
  Who’s iron man?
  I’d rather be pepper Potts than dr strange
  Uncanny
  I mean what did you want
  I really liked it
  Better all be nice to me
  Yeah I’ve seen it
  He's teaching you more than just how to flip diggers, that's for suresies
  You’d think a lesson might’ve been learnt
  Crazy your boss has you drinking again
  Circle of life I guess
  Seems callous to me but there you go
  Encountered that when I first moved to London
  That people who jump on the tracks are ‘selfish’, cause they slow commuters down
  You know another one?
  A devil’s advocate of sorts
  Don’t worry Denny, I was just putting out a common London view for everyone
  Sad to see a cathedral to capitalism brought to its knees by some idiots with the sole skill of opposable thumbs to push a lever forward
  What happens when the unions get too strong
  Keep the jobs in the family
  Yeah but they get paid way too much
  That takes an ability to subvert the norm that I think deserves to survive
  But also, do you mean they had a go while actually being on the train, rather than just jumping on the tracks?
  Can’t imagine anyone trying to kill themselves if they got to share a train ride with you
  Sure, but let me know where you’re eating!
  I’ll come for dinner sure!
  It blows!
  I shoot someone with a sweet headshot then they just build a two mile tall tower and heal before I can finish them off
  I know it sucks
  That’s true
  Cause Lukey and Whitey suck and I don’t know if it’s just cause the game’s hard
  And won?
  Have you ever played fortnite jack or jack?
  Lol yep
  I’m pretty good
  I’m playing fortnite
  No milkshake ipa for you
  Oh no
  The favourite?
  🙄
  Ok just do your favorites of the year whenever they were released
  You’ll get the answer when I know if you even deserve to have the name of milkshake ipas on your lips
  Let’s say released
  You have to list your favorite album, book, and movie of 2018
  We have a culture test in the T10
  Ok Danny
  I wouldn’t recommend it for a fucking philistine like you
  It’s the _latest_ thing in craft ales
  Also jack ask for ‘milkshake IPAs’ when you’re in shoreditch
  Nice place to propose
  Iyou going with Charlotte?
  Can’t take phone calls cause I’m america
  Nice place
  Spent half my life there
  You better not let the hulk hear you chatting that shit
  Haven’t seen Ultron. Too late now
  the new one?
  Girls love that kind of mature self confidence
  Lol
  Fond memories
  I do remember!
  Sorry josh I missed this first time round
  You guys remeber when I had that hole in my pocket and I put my dick through it and used to try and get girls to put there hand in there?
  I’m incredibly hard done by
  My mum didn’t get me a birthday present this year
  I got nothing
  My cousin’s. She tried to stop them but the breeder said no
  Quite a nice dog but whenever it walks it looks stupid
  Yeah it’s horrible
  Wait no, no tail at all. It wiggles its butt when it’s happy
  Stump
  Apparently all these dogs have to have their tails cut off
  They cut his tail off
  Rowan
  My doggy
  He’s pretty in the sun
  I heard the famous Hollywood film Hangover was based on it
  Always knew they’d be friends
  Is that dan saxton?
  No way
  You still in America parry?
  don't need to see that on a saturday morning
  He always does :(
  Can’t you see there’s more that ties you together than pulls you apart?
  Bicker bicker bicker all the time!
  God you two need to cool it
  I look like John hurt
  Three years ago he was high in cellar and said he’s not cooking an more
  Show me a man who deserves it more
  Good to see Fionn confident and successful with his new Canadian airport business
  Bad luck
  I’m at this really crazy Sunderland game
  No spoilers please!
  You got there
  Your friendship is like notre dame’s steeple right now
  Wow
  He can be from the Lake District for all I care
  That song has nothing to do with us denny
  Ooh baby those are good cookies
  Come on guys you have to do better than this!
  God I leave Europe for one second and notre dame burns down
  Did you say hello?
  Lol
  Gz josh
  The stores must killing it
  He added me as a friend so I could see that?!
  Jesus
  Nah you’re right. I always knew I’d save the world 😎
  Lucky escape for us aid workers and socialised medicine practitioners that escaped capitalism’s evil call
  Can’t believe so many of us became big bankers and corporate lawyers
  She works for the banks now
  Lol
  You becoming an art collector?
  Not worth the awful people
  What’s stopping you putting an offer on and sealing the deal in a day?
  Like, if you see a house and you like it
  Why months?
  Yeah, someone bought a dictionary recently
  I don’t know if I’d say that
  Bet insurance we’re happy do shell out
  Nice
  What happened?!
  New cover photo
  At least if you write a bad song like Tints you’re trying to be jazzy
  It’s boring!
  I can brand you :)
  But shes moved out I think
  I’ve never met the boyfriend but the girl’s a-ok in my book
  I’d say
  location 4/5,
  accommodation 4/5
  Price 3/5
  Flat mates 1/5
  Maybe end of July but jack’s already got a decent place so I have to make a strong pitch 💯
  I hope so

  Thanks Denny
  I’m a professional baker
  That rob?
  £40 bargain
  Jeez
  Airport shower?
  And a man sitting on it
  Homosexual? The courts have nothing on ya
  Homo erotic, yes
  Drip dry in the airport lounge
  My airport life hack
  Splash yourself with urinal spray
  Probably shouldn’t send you that, bet they’re bugging your phone
  Start kissing some men
  You in Brunei?
  I’ve heard good things
  You could probably dunk
  Slightly better
  Should’ve got loaded in the Wetherspoons
  No alcohol means it’s worthless
  Jesus
  I guess you didn’t get Diablo?
  Bang ‘em down hard and fast
  That’s what keeps me going back to Simpson’s road rage
  You need to make sure you get enough use out of your consoles
  I’d buy it
  26 damage
  That’s the saddest thing I’ever ever seen
  Stuff it!
  That’s enough Denny!
  So I wouldn’t wait up for it
  My maternal grandfather had a beautiful head of hair at 89
  Being bald doesn’t make people cunts josh
  I’m too popular
  Not sure I can be friends with you guys anymore
  We both are super cool
  @Josh Williams Bradley
  That’s Sasha stancliffe bird
  Lol
  YOU’RE FULL OF SHIT!
  And you probably bowled a 300 last outing to the lanes
  Your dick’s probably 25 inches as well isn’t in Jack?
  It’s quite nice. We should put arty’s brain into one when his current body dies
  It looks like a Rottweiler with a dose of wimp
  That’s the one
  It looks nice in that photo but it’s the scary type of dog
  What type of dog is this?
  My leg’s pretty much healed now. I’ll never run again but at least I’m still here
  To stay awake in meetings yesterday I had to force my calf to cramp, and today it hurts :(
  Will Yonnssejnn already does josh
  ‘Kilo of granola’
  Good NHS joke josh
  At least I’ll be working in east London for the next two years. Their hospitals probably have artisanal beans coming out their ears
  It sucked!
  Finished the last bite in the shower as well
  I bet there are more
  I’ve found three costas in this hospital
  Yep :(
  It sucked!
  I had one plain bagel this morning
  Just cause you have a Costa and an orange lucozade sport before work doesn’t mean I shouldn’t have the option of an artisanal roastery in the hospital
  Sometimes cliches are true josh
  There’s nothing I hate more than costa coffee
  Denny forever!
  God that was a nice Monday
  We should have ‘nice mondays’
  Enough bad blood in British politics
  We should all be nice to each other on a Monday evening
  No I won’t be having this either
  I don’t want 74 notifications on a Monday night
  Wow you’ve done a lot to your garden as well
  Yeah it’s a conspiracy cause he was making a documentary about a doctor who Jada cure for aids but got killed too
  Don’t talk that way!
  Don’t say that Denny
  You’d probably have to add her as a friend
  Lol
  Matt’s in the dog house!!!
  Nah she was in year 7 maths with Mr Coy
  Denny does know Joanne
  Don’t worry Denny
  I like going to the cinema on my own :)
  I banged my knee falling off my friends bike the other week. It hurt!
  Arty’s first baby face to eat :)

  This is like the Manhattan project all over again
  He’s gone rogue!
  Fuck me
  Shit SHIT
  Sue, they’re fighting again
  Oh Denny
  Is your big news the new sunglasses?
  Weather’s not as nice today
  We moved from WhatsApp just for him!!
  It’s Bailey I’m looking for
  I’ve seen Tom here a few times
  No babies allowed
  I’d say we get Luke our first
  He almost got one there cause I wasn’t concentrating, thanks for the heads up Jack
  :)
  Sorry jack I didn’t know you wrote that, you’re on hearts too
  Josh is the only one of youse who managed two nice things
  And don’t have to be in till 11 today so that admittedly helps...
  I got 8.5!
  Diggers flying everywhere
  Bet you all got back on the pints by 11am and things worked themselves out pretty soon after
  Sure is :(
  Bet it was awkies at work today josh
  Yeah but that’s cause I’m on the codeine
  I forgot your birthday was the day before mine Denny
  He’ll take a few more punks
  Though it seems like you’ve got some more leeway with your boss
  Good life choice
  Nice
  He’s just playing coy
  My knees fucked too but I’m at work
  That’s too bad!
  What about you jj?
  I get in at 21:08
  No way?
  A walk: The good man’s wank
  Lol
  Oops there you go!
  The airport I bet :)
  From where?
  No way!
  I’m on the train going past reading
  Wow, if that doesn’t keep you alive nothing will
  None of that dan please
  Has he read/responded to your message?
  Keys to the digger aren’t coming back, that’s for sure
  A few insults at a rugby match aren’t that fucking bad
  Yeah I reckon you’ll be fine.
  It’s not actually infected, that’s something called ‘slough’ that means it’s healing
  lol I did
  Didn’t know the diabetic ulcers would get me so soon
  Powerful way to shed light on one’s failures
  They played in on repeat on a plane I was on once
  Lol
  Have you messaged him this morning?
  You’ll always have riptide
  All my nurses will be robots 🤖
  I’d say you’re a good man, who should only have to deal with one jonner in his life 💖
  (Have to give them whenever asked now)
  Sorry also didn’t realise I was asked for a diagnosis
  I always get a bit fighty after the rugby. Monday morning buy him a coffee and you’ll be all good
  Is that just calling it a day on the conersatIon?
  Damn
  Excited for the cup?
  Got there’s nothing I love more than watching Harry Kane bang in pennas
  I’m living a dennymare
  you missed even less than usual
  Always enjoy using this app for top tips
  Thanks Josh!
  Still giving you lessons after all this time...
  Was gonna have to let you know that we don’t engage with serious politics here
  Thought you’d just sent the brexit one dan
  Afters*
  As long as we get bottomless ice cream for our after a
  Oh yeah
  I’m down for pizza
  This poll is no longer available.
  That’s fucking crazy
  Horrible stuff
  🤢
  Yeah it’s not looking good for Heinz
  I forgot about that
  Oh yeah same with taps!
  I went 10 rounds with the floor and the floor won
  I think he was fine, just when we landed on the floor he thought he’d killed josh
  I guess your 4hed’s made of stronger stuff
  I’m just glad your head’s ok, after hearing parry’s warning shouts that his own knees busted it in
  Oh I knew the risks when I strapped myself onto the handlebars of the fastest backy-er this side of the m25
  She is a sewing queen 😍
  Me brand new cords!
  My trousers are fucked, that’s the saddest part
  Hmmm
  And both my knee caps went 10 rounds with the floor
  And then we all fell
  (Which he’d already done once on the ride)
  And on the big Tesco roundabout josh decided to wobble the bike as a joke
  Was sitting on josh’s handlebars while parry sat on the seat and josh cycled
  But I mean I’m still walking so it should be fine
  It def hurts a lot more than the scrape
  Can’t hardly walk
  It owies so much!
  Sweet Jesus
  10 mins
  Ty
  On bus from town now
  A graffiti artist that lacks conviction
  Does that say oooops?
  I always get a fish dinner at Big Willy M’s
  Chefs at the old willy M will grill that up a treat
  Ooh bring it along
  It’s had a nice haircut!
  Nope
  Was gonna get a bus soon
  I’m in town now
  Sounds good to me
  Yeah you have to come to London more often! Loved getting the bus with you
  Best time ever
  HEY
  Whining on some hoe I found
  How’s that?!
  I’m gonna have to look like a ‘Cristina Rodriguez’ 💁‍♀️
  Oh yeah we’re looking good
  Lol I know
  If you keep bitching out on me jack you’re not getting your knife
  And I fixed it in so minutes
  Look what I’m dealing with
  Nice
  Lol
  🙃
  FIREMEN!
  Ready?
  I think you've all guessed apart from Jhonny B
  that was
  no sorry I was just reflecting on what a stupid guess
  Priests.
  I’m normally a tinnies in the park kinda guy but cool
  sorry Tom, valuation surveyors are third
  :o
  you get nothing because you're a cheat!
  People hate nurses josh don’t be silly
  Nope
  Only 1 guess each
  £5 to whoever guesses!!
  Go hire a child prostitue you sicko
  Second most trusted apparently
  Really glad I have your approval
  Thanks dan
  Also dan apparently our group thinks it’s funny to be dyslexic
  How can you operate on something that doesn’t exist Hosh?
  Obviously you get better at the slightly more difficult things like open heart surgery, but it’s pretty much floodgates from day 1
  Yep that’s pretty much it
  That’s cause I’m a doctor 🤫
  I think like me and maybe 10-20% of fellow medical students
  🤭
  And when he gets home from a hectic day at work he likes to enjoy Steady as she goes by the Raconteurs
  Dan says he’s still into rage against the machine but listens to Dua Lipa on his iPod touch
  We’re either coming, or getting scammed by a pretty good fake FB account
  Bailey’s gone downhill but still hot af
  Didn’t realise I’d become a solid 6/10
  Dan probably thinks I’m still short and chubby
  I don’t think the four foot two undernourished Irish had a problem with that
  Lol
  BUT PROVABLY £2.50 WHEN YOU ADD IN P&P lol!!
  £5 more than face value
  Or chopped to little pieces
  Let’s hope me and parry won’t get scammed :)
  Could probably flip your digger
  No Dan, no!!!!
  But if you shit in a cubicle, even if it’s a really stinky shit and you’re on your phone for a while too, the shit smell doesn’t stick to your clothes
  Like most cooking smells stick to you, so if you cook in an enclosed space you smell like food
  Do you know what’s lucky? That poo smell isn’t the type of smell that sticks to you
  Josh remember, the customer is always right. And that’s you here
  Jhon Bott will help
  Take this all the way to the Supreme Court
  He should have insurance
  Come to Ashford and race me
  Christian union wasn’t a place, it was a state of mind
  Swear I do
  Does anyone recognise the name Catherine Shaw, the girl from Witney who’s in the news?
  No deal
  I heard FABULOUS things
  Probably when you guys all move to Leeds together
  Incense
  God check that ice on my wrist
  🤪
  Gilbert grape
  The guy from up wants some downers
  Wowzers*
  Wow era
  Kind of makes me feel happy I was still invited when all I was bringing was paperweights
  Can’t believe you invited JFB
  I remember that party. We played age of empires
  Fuck, he must get around
  My granddad can pull it off
  Bad and bougie
  Fuck
  Hmm. I guess start small. Make robots that look after babies and then scale up?
  Give me like 5% equity and just make sure you make billions
  Can we do the thing where I rubber stamp the project with my ‘Dr’ name and then you do the rest?
  For sure
  Until you get seizures
  Pretty good
  ☹️
  That’s my advice
  Until you get seizures
  Take it all!
  Good stuff
  End of an era
  God
  ;)
  Oh yeah sorry Dan nvm he died in year 10
  I saw them together in cellar it was so cute
  Wtf why did no one tell me?!
  She’s a whole lotta woman
  Wow
  Cool name
  Though I don’t know who Lydia Paladina is
  Damn, sounds like a party
  Go on
  I’ve got birds in my kitchen too!
  Trying to get you out of this mess
  Shhh Dan the grownups are talking
  Don’t you know he’s a human like you or me? And he deserves some of the respect that any human deserves
  God you’re like a child josh. Dan’s flavour of the month one minute, then the next you toss him aside like an old doll
  😮
  i love what a fake bitch you are Josh <3
  This chat is getting a bit spunky
  This is all a big AI experiment
  Don’t be silly jack, Dan’s the robot, not you
  If nothing else, you’ve got the significant costs for the highly-skilled and in demand graphic designer
  Light of my life
  And Nova 😍
  Yeah except Caitlin 🤩
  Australians worst in the world
  :(
  IM OUT
  I’ve learnt the hard way about investing £100 in T10 schemes
  And punch people at frat parties
  They all wear goose
  Aunt’s house
  My dog’s a face biter
  Also that dog’s uglier than Arthur
  Pretty sure my dog’s scarier than yours
  The best GIFs are always the ones that need a bit of explanation on the side
  We can bring pasties and a portable DVD player with doctor who but I think we’ll have to leave Sally at home
  Yeah I saw that video
  There’s roles for everyone
  Josh & Bailey - sniper team
  Peter - medic
  Jhon Bott - collateral damage
  Jack Parry - tech shit
  Tom Vecchione - punching the jihadi’s lights out
  Jack Jennings - moans about the camping element
  Dan Saxton - fun messages from back home on FB chat if we’re bored
  We could stage a rescue mission for Jack Letts
  Hmm
  I think it’s time to test all of our friendships abroad
  Sounds good to me josh
  God you’ve got a lot to learn
  Only Tom’s allowed to use the 😂 emoji
  Doug Stanhope’s real name
  Like Ross Jonson at a feminist convention
  Sad to watch
  Either of them tbh
  Rarely goes well
  He regularly faces off against Dave McGiver on the comedy circuit
  That should be your whole standup routine Josh
  ‘Gay, you must be gay’
  Lol
  Definitely SFW anyone who hasn’t clicked :)
  Wowzers
  You love a bit of St George don’t you josh

  What do I do if I think there are neonazis in the gym?
  Don’t worry, Sunderland came back from 2-0 down on Friday
  And he doesn’t like it when he does neever
  Josh goes to London once every 18 months
  She did meant she didn’t do her geography a level I think
  But we’re Dunn with him
  And you’re talking about Ollie Dunn
  She’s gone now

  Some people just want to watch the world burn dan
  God he has a busy weekend
  Those are juicy!
  It’s tough being a professional football player
  No randiness on the chat please dan
  Back when dragons were dragons and girls were girls
  Good wholesome family fun

  Lots of dragons and it’s sad then happy
  You guys should go and see how to train your dragon 3, it’s great!
  A mate of ours showed him how

  I LOVE IT!! I FUCKING LOVE IT!
  You’re disagreeing but I love both of your content!!!
  I like that bit of that movie Dan

  That still makes me fill sick to my stomach
  Lol
  He’s the modern Prometheus

  More like boycott and divest in Jack
  BDS!!
  That’s ok man you’re learning
  We actually don’t use digital blackface in this group Dan
  Def not a deal breaker
  But you do you
  I’ve kind of come out the other end of my rage against the machine phase
  And you can be my valentine
  You move wherever you want Dan
  Not cool
  Really went in on Dan there guys
  You’re welcome
  What about Sam Smith?
  Lies
  Doctor $ sent a link.

  Fallen a long way since you knew me
  (I live a sad, sad life in Ashford Dan)
  Now I’m going back to Ashford
  And there was some cheese in the cupboard
  I had some crackers
  Hmmm
  Don’t listen to that Dan
  Yeah he leaves his sense of humour on the stage when it comes to FB chats
  Breathe
  I can breath again
  Nice
  But when we added him to our group he didn’t appreciate with the grace and generosity of spirit that you have
  Similar episode to this
  Funny you should ask
  He deleted me 😡
  I don’t think he’d appreciate it :(
  (We’re good at supporting each other in this friendship group :) )
  That was pretty sick man keep it up
  On the big building
  Oh show Dan your graffiti
  Some of us have ps4s which I guess is pretty cool
  For moving?
  Not how I remember it but I guess we’ll have to agree to disagree
  Dan left in year 10
  Def a lot of 420 ;)
  They killed my cat but no hard feelings cause your mum hadn’t been there for like 10 years
  I know
  Dark years
  The vet is!
  I’m standing :(
  Put a couple of them in 200 overnight and you’ve got yourself a Sunday brunch dit for the gods
  Wow that is good value
  Loosely based
  I think she thinks it’s tres bien merci
  Crazy shit
  And so is tom’s
  My mum’s in Newcastle too
  You’ve been better than we ever could’ve hoped for Dan 💖
  Capital letters?
  Josh doesn’t speak for the rest of us with his gross, eager to please crudeness
  Josh fancies her now and asks her on dates when she’s in town
  Maslen fuck
  And Amber Malden :)
  Dan we should let you know we’re all really into the hit Japanese show Terrace House

  Lewi Knox
  Hello dan :)
  He looks weird now
  Lol
  I’ll replace your knee for you
  Lol Jesus
  Yeah I’m out and about I’m afraid
  Me and me mum used to go down to supa saver and (watch people) put money on their cards
  Silver spoon
  Lol
  Hate it when I can’t pay the leccy
  Lol
  I’m in Newcastle sorry Tom ☹️
  So that’s one
  I always thought of Dino as well meaning
  I’d say write 50,000 words and we can probably sell it to a well-meaning publishing house
  Your spelling could be a new kinda of patois to rival a clockwork orange!
  To be honest I think most narrative nonfiction books are written in less than 6 months cause you just write wot appened to ya
  Yes, there’s another famous nonfiction book written very quickly, that that GIF could also symbolise!
  But a fiction one, alas
  That GIF symbolises a famous book that was written in less than 6 months
  With a flare for penis that will see you either elevated above all others, or cast down by a society that’s not ready for cocks

  Lol
  Football lost

  Yeah come to London Tom
  Who said brexit won’t work 🤩
  That’s what you get when you mess with the mainland
  I don’t like the English rugby team but damn I hate the Irish
  That’s one fat chode
  I’m old fashioned like that
  I don’t ask a lady’s age
  You’re drunk again aren’t you

  I said I’d been missing _my_ bean, and winked at her
  I saw Molly McGunnigle the other day I’m missing bean
  (Not what schizophrenia really is)
  Schizophrenic joy!
  Thanks guys, I feel both those sentiments myself
  Found out I passed the big exams two days ago
  Yep basically
  But I can’t call myself a doctor officially until I graduate at the start of July
  People are writing annoying Facebook statuses saying “I’m Dr Blah blah, MBBS”
  Hmmm
  I’m on a register for people who are shit at medicine so they toss me round like a hot potato
  I could be projecting as I won’t be able to work in the same place for more than a year for at least the next six years
  Cause as josh said when you get older your knees go and shit
  But Tom my serious answer is I think young people should have a low threshold for moving around
  Lol not to my knowledge
  God I wouldn’t make 80k as a photographer I’ll tell you that
  Just remember Tom, whatever you choose to do, you can’t buy beautiful west Oxford sunsets
  Initially
  Then sell out for 5k more than they offer
  And the friendships you’ve build over years of rewarding work
  Try and work out how much money the relaxed atmosphere is worth
  Nah wouldn’t say there’s anything new
  Parry made a cool documentary down Cowley centre http://youtu.be/ZwbYjgL0qdA
  Don’t even joke about something like that
  You could not
  🤫
  I wonder if he could do a whole steak platter
  He should see how many of us he can beat in an eating competition at once
  Lol also the T10 as well as the cricket team
  And he’s in direct competition with Will Yyjjonsen for next member of the T20
  He’s actually a good _friend_ of mine and jack’s
  Lol
  Yeah fuck all of youse
  The never ending story
  Don’t graduate until July :(
  And I’m a psychopath so that’s easy for me 👹🤪
  They’ve made them easier for the last two years so you basically can pass by pretending to be nice rather than knowing any medicine
  Find out next week if I have to resit so at least I don’t have to worry for that long
  I think they were ok Tom
  Yeah it’s a subtle metaphor
  There’s your Pulitzer
  I turned it into a metaphor for man against woman
  Nice and warm though 😊
  He’s still there now :(
  Double the warmth, double the price 😎
  Buy the size up and wear one on top of the other
  A champagne supper
  I never signed up for this type of group
  Good gracious
  It’s a slow news day so you could probably get a front page splash
  Yeah it’s not really a Gerard Butler situation is it
  You should put cotton eye joe on repeat
  Tell him his godfather’s never been more proud
  This is bigger than the time Trevor nelson gave you a shout out
  So it didn’t come up in the first pics but now I see it
  I was expecting to see arty :(
  But it’ll be fine
  Um I think so. They’re like the practical ones where you have to do stuff and get asked stuff while doctors watch, so I feel a bit like I’m about to be in a play where the outcome decides the rest of my life
  yeah finals tuesday wednesday 😬
  After what they did for my city post-Katrina, I’ll never let them down
  I’m only interested in watching the saints
  resemblance is uncanny
  Lol
  High as a kite
  He’s high
  No that part isn’t real :(
  Lol
  They were making him shout ‘this.. is... ENTERPRISE!’
  I know :(
  He was pretending to smash a window in
  Swear it
  Just walked past Gerard Butler doing an advert for enterprise rentacar
  You haven’t seen style like this since the mid 90s
  Sadie called my new shoes ‘stylish’ 😎
  We can do help to buy
  That’s a poem!
  And inside Trevor only lets you in to VIP if you whisper ‘midge2bella’ into his ear
  No Arthur’s the bouncer and if you give him a scratch on the head he lets you in ☺️
  Niche*
  Maybe there’s finally a nice for the T10 Club
  Oxford nightlife scene has really taken a hammering recently
  Never been inside <\3
  Yeah it’ll be too late if you leave it for even another day
  Yeah they tossed in the ice on my neck and the forehead tattoo for free
  I think I got a good person though. She was late 30s and polish and the instructor let her do her thing. Someone of the teenage guys seemed dodgy though
  Like significantly better than £13 at the botley road place
  £15 quid saved I can now invest 😎
  Just got my free haircut from the barber school
  I slept straight away cause getting high is kind of normal for me
  In fact I’m high right now

  Oh sorry they hate you. They’ve got that wrong though you’re a great guy and never forget it
  Lol
  That’s what that question was about
  That’s why I asked if you wanted to get dinner tonight
  Oxford!
  I may have forgotten most of the t10 Christmas, but I remember some tentative pushes for Ross
  Lol
  Think it is and if not other antihistamines would do they same thing
  Yeah I was thinking you could probably make it
  Antihistamine makes you sleepy, perfect for getting drowsy on that drank and curing any gluten sneezes you may have 😎

  Yeah me too
  I got a pint of pineapple juice at the fishes 🤪

  to be honest if I only had access to the Westgate for a few days of the year, I'd be down there 24/7
  Breast feeding three small bairns
  Just being cuckolded for Phil fucking Taylor

  You’d never have found bailey without a sound topographical knowledge of st ebbes
  Is that the thing he did on Christmas Day?
  There is such a thing as art that isn’t subtle enough 🙁
  There’s no such thing as worse art
  In fantastic beasts I would’ve just joined grindlewald

  I was in fantastic beasts and where to find them
  One sec I’ll show you what that would’ve looked like
  Better than a homophobic cake
  I even made a cake for you Bailey
  Good omen for a birthday I reckon
  Had a dream we were all in Thailand and went to an earl sweatshirt concert that bailey and josh found out about
  (That was Father Christmas saying happy birthday)
  H-h-h-haaaappoyy birthday
  Didn’t investigate, came as soon as I saw the cover photo
  *faints*
  thought you ought to know
  TWINS! TWINS! DANIELLE ANDERSON HAS TWINS
  Fucking pissed off i missed it now
  I’d rather do them at Billy’s... but also mine are quite big so might be a pain in the arse whatever we do
  Bailey with his future sight was giving you the power to enact revenge on the drone flyers who got you so bad this Christmas
  So really you should be mad at yourself
  And my present is great you just haven’t taken advantage of it
  And yeah jack’s present was quite good so don’t be mad at him
  That’s not a very Christmassy attitude josh
  I just want no part of it
  You get each other really nice presents like mobile phones, it’s fun to watch
  That would be quite nice
  Lol
  Now someone else is gonna get an Afro comb
  I bet you just bought something for bailey cause you assumed you had him
  I know what my secret Santa’s getttingggggg
  I’ll tell you what, there are some great Oral B deals on amazon
  Lol
  Isn’t that the one you got?
  Lol no of course not
  Bet you’re feeling like a fool now josh

  I’ll be in Ireland in a week so probably’ll say hi to them
  Nan*
  Probably same man
  Fake Irishman
  Jeez
  Did he come over in the end?
  Jewel of the north
  Yeah, going to East Boldon
  No it’s a pretty traditional set up I’m afraid.
  Ummm don’t think so?
  They give them to everyone who gets a knighthood
  God I love that bear
  Best part is Naomi didn’t get any cause she’s in Canada 👹
  I just got my grandparent money 🤑
  I gave him a like
  I like this
  That’s not him
  Jesus
  Oh yeah he’s like a more boring version of Leo hadji
  Feels like the end of a Simpson’s Christmas special
  This is nice
  I bet sue’s having to play a peacekeeping Pete
  Lol
  That’s very festive!
  Maybe he’s just taking the piss
  That’s good shit
  Lol
  Good for him
  Swear he’s put some weight on
  Say what you want about colonialism, but we gave them the railroads
  I’m the family member who drinks too much and says contentious things
  Vaccines cause autism
  Who’s your sister sending morse code to?
  But we’re always eating 😏
  Sounds good. I need to eat first otherwise I’ll be hangry at all of you
  Two tables 😎
  Christmas is the time of year when I really most appreciate divorced parents 💖
  Got some ice on my wrist as well
  What did you get jack?
  Pretty good
  Lol
  £100 Waterstones voucher 🤘
  Hope everyone got nice presents
  Was about to but the call didn’t last long enough
  🎱
  Ho ho ho meeerrrrry Christmas!
  Some compared it to the Socratic dialogues
  I’m upset at myself
  I have always played well with pussy audiences ;)
  That attitude isn’t going to play well with audiences
  No one wants to listen to me and bailey argue for two hours after Tom finally stops complaining about being ‘ill’ and goes to bed
  Facebook just told me first t10 Christmas was four years ago
  Thanks for providing the homophobic drunken person my own family should but don’t provide
  I dont know how you can even joke about Arty winning fights when you’ve seen him be dominated sexually by so many tiny dogs
  It’s my cousin’s
  Josh what type of dog is that?
  Even if I wasn’t working I’d be at Sam’s b day party so I’m double busy
  I’m kind of busy I’m afraid
  Guys stop fighting it’s Christmas
  I saw him in this great independent film called Face/Off and wanted to see his latest
  Has anyone seen Mandy with an actor called Nicholas Cage
  Unfortunately Josh interprets Ross Jonson’s work as cinematic, musical, and playful, and I can’t bear the thought of hearing his name spoken three times
  That’s a duck
  We suppress
  My family doesn’t argue
  Having contacts at channel 14 is a joke too far for josh
  Lol
  Don’t know how you’re gonna do that since he deleted you as a friend
  That ‘joke’ might typify your humour. I’d definitely lead/close with it in your next show
  I always preferred Billy Rae
  We know. Can’t even spell your own nickname

  You wish you knew either of the people in that photo
  Talking of bulging hearts 💖
  My heart bulges with the pain of it
  All the brothers I lost in the battle of the bulge <\3
  I think about it daily
  I do, but on the bright side, you’ve got three free trips to London whenever you want to redeem them, whereas everyone else has probably finished with all the enjoyment of their old gifts
  My person should have low expectations cause I’m poor as fuck, but then they’re gonna be extra happy cause my present is actually awesome
  You should have your own talk radio show
  Unless you’re bleeding out your peepee. Never leave that
  Nothing funny about your anus after seeing it in the cold light of a Scottish morning
  Oh. I mean I know you have problems with your arse so probably not something to joke about
  (Proper gp style)
  One sec I’m at my computer
  And cuts etc
  Doctors say see them if there’s been blood for 2-3 weeks which seems crazy to me. I guess cause 90% is haemorrhoids
  £80 return with a rail card but bought quite late this time. Can be anywhere between £45 and £90 return depending on times

  T10 jet isn’t know for its speed is it

  You know Sadie’s friend Globes is in Syria? He’s meeting imprisoned terrorists this weekend, maybe Jack will be amongst them
  Lol
  Josh will punt all day while I sit in my palazzo buying paintings and blowing glass
  I’m gonna take my canoe to Venice and get rich!
  Stock markets crashing means a good day for cryptos!
  I was walking along

  I not actually
  Kicked*
  Seems like no one’s told all the fans their gonna get their too shoes lichee
  I ended up by the emirates and didn’t realise they’re playing Tottenham tonight
  Kind of crazy
  In 1925, more than one in every 20 men in the UK were coal miners
  Cool I’ll bring my skateboard
  Where was it again?
  Oh yeah you booked somewhere instead of us cooking
  💖
  Like always
  I was super fun I remember
  At least they can afford branded honey nut Cheerios. I’d probably go for Tesco’s own
  Just read back and thought the whole argument thing was started by jack in his first edit
  I liked it but that was before I saw Jack’s
  You look like chechnyan coke addicts
  You should all be ashamed of yourselves
  That’s disgusting
  ;)
  And I’m dfw
  I’m a nice fun person

  You’ll be sorry when I’m ripping it past Osney Lock in a 350cc pleasure cruiser

  Pretty nice
  Wish I was :(
  Is the British property market that weak?
  Tom how are you in Venice like a week after Berlin?
  (Nice smog parry)
  I’ve never owned a vape!
  Are you drunk?
  3-5 lying in the road stopping cars

  Harvey?
  Weird, that looks like the smallest, when everyone knows we’re the biggest screwers around
  Must be the Valium’s talking
  That’s a dopey sense of humour
  Wahhhhh
  Should’ve had James hemshall fighting for them
  Lol they sure do
  And the duke of Edinburgh leader driving the bus was silent
  I once watched him sit in tears for 30 mins in a minibus while vecchione and jonner sang “fuck James hemshall” to the tune of fuck the police by NWA
  Say it ain’t so
  :o
  Ooh daz nice
  Looks like the type of cut white people arent allowed
  Lol
  Unless it’s at the cage and then we use it as our group photo 💖
  Yeah that’s fine. We also all poop but we keep it to ourselves
  🎱
  He writes bad poetry
  I don’t know what to do
  Years after he deleted me as a friend, George Richardson comes back for more
  who did you get to lie down on the floor just to get a low-angle, thereby making you look powerful and authoritative (Year 9 English serving me well)
  🤢
  First question whenever planing an event
  They call it the Turkish transfer
  Yeah get it on your tits and I’ll rub mine on yours for an imprint
  I don’t know!!
  Probably an algorithm cause I got so many mutual friends with them
  Fuck me o
  Rufus just came on my discover weekly Spotify

  Good choice

  New Chelsea football ground
  Going from the land of terriers to the land of Killas

  Didn’t see I was pissing her off by taking a photo of her 👹
  And her owner said “no fucking way, not on the train”, and then she stopped
  She barked at me
  It’s crazy everyone in the T10 has a girlfriend
